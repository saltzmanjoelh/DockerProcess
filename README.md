# DockerProcess

Use of Process (formerly NSTask) with Docker to run Swift code on Linux from Xcode

I use this with [XcodeHelperCli](https://www.github.com/saltzmanjoelh/XcodeHelperCli) to 
- [Build and run tests on Linux through Docker](https://www.github.com/saltzmanjoelh/XcodeHelperCli#build-and-run-tests-on-linux-through-docker)
- [Tar and upload your binary to AWS S3 buckets.](https://www.github.com/saltzmanjoelh/XcodeHelperCli#tar-and-upload-you-linux-binary-to-aws-s3-buckets)
